# Carbon_footprint_Calculator
This Calculator enables one to see the amount of carbon he/she is emitting on daily basis using electricity used, Food taken and the distance traveled through vehicles.  
It also provides personalized eco-friendly suggestions to help reduce the footprint, along with a visual pie chart breakdown of emissions
# FEATURES
1)Calculates carbon emissions from travel, electricity, and diet.

2)Provides personalized suggestions for reducing emissions.

3)Generates a pie chart visualization using Matplotlib.

4)Built with Tkinter for a modern and interactive GUI.

5)Includes error handling and reset functionality for smooth user experience.

A carbon footprint measures the total greenhouse gas emissions caused directly or indirectly by human activities.
This project converts daily lifestyle data into estimated CO₂ emissions (in tons per year) using scientific emission factors.

# CODE OVERVIEW
Main GUI: Built using tkinter (labels, buttons, and input fields).

Logic: Calculates annual CO₂ emissions using emission factors.

Chart: Displays a pie chart with emission distribution.

Error Handling: Alerts users if invalid inputs are entered.

Reset Function: Resets all input fields and clears results.
